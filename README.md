# Shibboleth Service-Provider made with Docker

The eLearning platform Ilias is used as a service in this context.


## Preconditions
For the host system, I recommend using a virtual machine with Debian Jessy. In addition you will need Docker and Docker Compose on your host system. 
Therefor you can use the [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/debian/) and the [Compose Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).


## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository on your host system
2. Navigate into the directory
3. There you can build the docker-image with the command 
```bash 
docker-compose build
 ```
